# Higher Lower Game

Welcome to the Higher Lower Game, a fun and interactive guessing game built with Python. In this game, players compare the follower counts of two different accounts (from a pre-defined instagram dataset) and guess which one has more followers.

## How to Play

The game presents you with two options: 'A' and 'B'. Each option corresponds to a public figure or entity with a certain number of followers. Your task is to decide which one has a higher follower count. If you guess correctly, you move on to the next round with your score incremented by one. The game continues until you make an incorrect guess, at which point your final score is presented.

## Installation

Before you can run the game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Once you have Python, you can clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yoohoo-cf/Higher_Lower_Game.git
```bash

## Running the game
To start the game, navigate to the project directory and run the following command in your terminal:
Run: python3 main.py
Replace main.py with the actual name of your Python script if it's different.
